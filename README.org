* Modus Operandi Emacs

Modus Operandi Emacs is a project that aims to provide a robust, fast and
scalabale development environment. It supports multiple programming languages
and file formats, using relevant language servers and major modes.

** Emacs installation
I strongly recommend using Emacs 28.0 (dev) with native compilation (GccEmacs).

*** MacOS
Using [[https://brew.sh/][brew]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus@28 --with-native-comp
ln -s /usr/local/opt/emacs-plus@28/Emacs.app /Applications/Emacs.app
#+END_SRC

** Dependencies
You should have the following software installed:
1. [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] - like grep, but faster
2. [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd][fd]] - like find, but faster
3. [[https://github.com/GNUAspell/aspell][aspell]] - for spell check
4. [[https://github.com/Kitware/CMake][cmake]] - for compiling vterm

** Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/manzaltu/modus-emacs ~/.emacs
#+END_SRC

Optionally, you can install [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2][chemacs2]] and use this configuration alongside others.

** Personalized Settings
You can create a file named personal.el in your Emacs folder and add
personalized settings. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; personal.el --- Personal configuration file -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; This is a personal configuration file

;;; Code:

;; Personal info
(setq user-full-name "Some Name"
      user-mail-address "user@domain.example")

;; Set font
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "PragmataPro Mono Liga-16"))

;;; personal.el ends here
#+END_SRC

** Getting updates
You can update the configuration by running the following command inside the
cloned dir:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git pull -r
#+END_SRC
